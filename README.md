# sorting-algorithms
This repository contains three quadratic two efficient sorting algorithms implemented using Java.
The quadratic algorithms include: 
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort

The efficient algorithms include:
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
### To run the sorting algorithms follow the bellow instructions

- Run `javac {nameOfTheJavaFile.java}` (e.g. javac InsertionSort.java)
- Run `java {nameOfTheJavaFile}` (e.g. java InsertionSort)
